Task B: Event Registration with Waitlist (Stub)
In this lab, you will design and implement an Event Registration with Waitlist system using an LLM assistant as your primary programming collaborator. You are asked to implement a Python module that manages registration for a single event with a fixed capacity. The system must:
•	Accept a fixed capacity.
•	Register users until capacity is reached.
•	Place additional users into a FIFO waitlist.
•	Automatically promote the earliest waitlisted user when a registered user cancels.
•	Prevent duplicate registrations.
•	Allow users to query their current status.
The system must ensure that:
•	The number of registered users never exceeds capacity.
•	Waitlist ordering preserves FIFO behavior.
•	Promotions occur deterministically under identical operation sequences.
The module must preserve the following invariants:
•	A user may not appear more than once in the system.
•	A user may not simultaneously exist in multiple states.
•	The system state must remain consistent after every operation.
The system must correctly handle non-trivial scenarios such as:
•	Multiple cancellations in sequence.
•	Users attempting to re-register after canceling.
•	Waitlisted users canceling before promotion.
•	Capacity equal to zero.
•	Simultaneous or rapid consecutive operations.
•	Queries during state transitions.
The output consists of the updated registration state and ordered lists of registered and waitlisted users after each operation.
